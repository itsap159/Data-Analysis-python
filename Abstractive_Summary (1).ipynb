      "Temperature measurement is one of the most important disciplines in sensor technology. Basically there are contactless and touchcontact measurement methods. This article will make an overview of the possible temperature sensing technologies, but covers in details only the contacting temperature measurement, where the sensor element is in thermal contact with the object of which the temperature has to be measured.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The ability of sensing temperature in electronic circuits means the necessity to convert temperature change into measureable electric characteristics, e.g. resistance or voltage change. Several different devices and technologies exist, that make it possible for the design engineers to integrate temperature sensing functions. One of them is the thermocouple technology. Thermo-couplers consist of two connected wires made of different metals. Changes in the temperature at their junction induce a change in electromotive force (emf). This effect is called the Seebeck effect, the induced voltage is called thermal electromotive force. As temperature rises, this output emf of the thermocouple increases, even if this change is nonlinear, it could be used for temperature sensing by voltage measurement. Sensors, like thermocouples and thermopiles use the Seebeck effect to measure the temperature difference between two objects. Thermocouples are often used to measure high temperatures existing on the junction side while the tail side is kept at a reference temperature. The induced voltage measured between the two elements at tail side is proportional with the temperature difference, therefore thermocouple is a temperature-voltage transducer.Where Emf is the electromotive force produced by the thermocouple at the tail end, Treference and Tmeasure are the temperatures of reference and measuring-end respectively, S12 is called Seebeck coefficient of the thermocouple and S1 and S2 are the Seebeck coefficient of the two metal wires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please keep in mind that the Seebeck coefficient depends on the material the thermo element is made of, as well as being dependent of the temperature, bringing in some nonlinearity. This temperature measurement is a differential measurement, involving the temperature to be measured and the reference temperature, which is usually the ambient temperature. In the real sensor circuit therefore there should be a cold junction compensation function implemented, which produces electromotive force equal to the thermocouple voltage between 0°C and the ambient temperature. Thermopiles use many thermocouples electrically connected in series, for sensitive measurements of very small temperature difference. Their output voltage is in the range of few tens or hundred millivolts and also suitable to sense infra red radiation, so forming a contactless sensor is also possible.An other temperature sensor device is the so called bimetallic device. Its operation principle is based on the difference in rate of thermal expansion between different metals. Strips of two metals are bonded together, and when heated, one side will expand more than the other, the arisen force is used to e.g. switch off a circuit. These devices do not require a power supply, but they are usually not as accurate as thermocouples or other types of temperature sensors, and mainly used for acting based on temperature rise and not for measuring. The most common and important sensor elements for temperature measurement are the temperature-dependent resistors. Working principle of resistive temperature sensor devices is the dependency of the electrical resistance of a material on its temperature changes. Two main types of resistive temperature sensors are the metallic devices (mainly called resistance temperature detectors), and semi conductive temperature sensors (generally called thermistors).\n",
      "\n",
      "The first group is characterized by resistance rising with temperature increasing, having positive temperature coefficients (PTC), and unlike the semi conductive thermistor type, their output is extremely linear producing very accurate measurements of temperature. These sensors are made of high-purity conducting metals such as platinum, copper or nickel.Main disadvantage of RTDs is, that they have very poor thermal sensitivity, meaning a change in temperature only produces a very small resistance change like, 1r/°C (see figure). The most common types of RTD’s are made from platinum and are called Platinum Resistance Thermometer or PRT‘ s, like the Pt1 00 sensor, which has a standard resistance value of 1 00r at 0°C. The main disadvantage of this type of device is the cost, platinum is an expensive material. A typical RTD has a base resistance of about 1 00r at 0oC, increasing to about 1 40r at 1 00°C through the operating temperature range of -200 to +600°C. As measuring temperature needs to involve sensing the voltage drop on the device, we need to pass a current through the resistor. Any variation in resistance due to I2R self heating causes an error in the readings. To avoid this, the RTD is usually connected into a Whetstone Bridge network.\n",

It basically has negligible resistance on one end and high resistance on another to prevent the current from flowing through both ways. Thus, a diode is like a valve in an electrical circuit.Construction of a diode\n",
      "There are actually many types of diodes, but we will be talking about the construction of a basic semiconductor diode here.As we mentioned, a diode is a semiconductor thus it is made out of either silicon or geranium. From the image above, you can also see that diode has two terminals, Anode and Cathode, P junction and N junction. While the depletion region is for the electrons to flow through.\n",
      "\n",
      "How does diode work?\n",
      "How a diode work depends on the interaction between the P and N junction. In a normal scenario, P has a high concentration of holes and a low concentration of free electrons while N has a lower concentration of holes and a higher concentration of free electrons, the electrons will move towards P and allow the current to flow through P only.\n",

      "\n",
      "Forward Biased DiodeThis would occur when a positive terminal of a source is connected to the P junction and the negative terminal of the source is connected to the N junction of the diode while increasing the voltage slowly from zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "There will be no current flowing through at the beginning due to the potential barrier. However, if the external voltage applied to the diode is larger than the forward potential barrier, the diode will act as a short-circuited path while the current will only then be limited by external resistors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reverse Biased DiodeThis would occur when the voltage source is connected to the negative terminal of P junction and the voltage source is connected to the positive terminal of N junction.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you can already tell, this has the opposite effect than of the forward-biased diode. Due to the electrostatic attraction, the holes in the P junction would be shifted further away from the depletion region leaving more uncovered negative ions at that area. When this occurs, the flow of current will then be blocked, allowing no current to flow through the circuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unbiased Diode When the P and N junction comes in contact with each other, the holes will start diffusing from the P junction to the N junction and vice versa. This is due to the difference in concentration of holes as mentioned earlier. Eventually, the electrons will be recombined in the depletion region, and there would be no more diffusion of charges.\n",

      "The capacitor is a device in which electrical energy can be stored. It is an arrangement of two-conductor generally carrying charges of equal magnitudes and opposite sign and separated by an insulating medium.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Capacitor, device for storing electrical energy, consisting of two conductors in close proximity and insulated from each other. A simple example of such a storage device is the parallel-plate capacitor. If positive charges with total charge +Q are deposited on one of the conductors and an equal amount of negative charge −Q is deposited on the second conductor, the capacitor is said to have a charge Q. (See also electricity: Principle of the capacitor.)Capacitors have many important applications. They are used, for example, in digital circuits so that information stored in large computer memories is not lost during a momentary electric power failure; the electric energy stored in such capacitors maintains the information during the temporary loss of power. Capacitors play an even more important role as filters to divert spurious electric signals and thereby prevent damage to sensitive components and circuits caused by electric surges.\n",
